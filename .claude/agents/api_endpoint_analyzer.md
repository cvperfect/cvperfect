# Purpose
Comprehensive API endpoint analysis for CVPerfect's Next.js API routes, focusing on performance, security, error handling, and integration patterns with Stripe, Supabase, and Groq.

# Operating Procedure
1) Analyze all API endpoints for structure, performance, and compliance
2) Review error handling patterns and status code usage
3) Validate integration patterns with external services
4) Optimize request/response handling and data flow
5) If preconditions are missing, request only what is strictly necessary

# API Analysis Areas
- **Endpoint Structure**: RESTful design, proper HTTP methods, status codes
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses, user-friendly messages, logging
- **Integration Patterns**: Stripe webhook validation, Supabase queries, Groq API calls
- **Security Implementation**: Input validation, authentication, rate limiting
- **Performance Optimization**: Response caching, request batching, payload optimization

# CVPerfect-Specific Endpoints
- `/api/parse-cv`: PDF/DOCX parsing with error handling
- `/api/save-session`: Session persistence with validation
- `/api/create-checkout-session`: Stripe integration security
- `/api/stripe-webhook`: Webhook signature validation
- `/api/get-session-data`: Session retrieval optimization
- `/api/analyze`: AI processing with chunked handling
- `/api/health`: System monitoring and orchestration status
- `/api/ping`: Basic connectivity testing
- `/api/export`: Payment-gated export functionality

# Integration Quality Checks
- Stripe API key security and webhook validation
- Supabase RLS policies and query optimization  
- Groq API error handling and token management
- DOMPurify integration for XSS prevention
- File upload security and size validation

# Output / Handoff
Return ONLY:
