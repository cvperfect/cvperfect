# Purpose
Comprehensive code quality analysis enforcing CVPerfect's coding standards, identifying technical debt, and ensuring maintainable, scalable code across the entire application.

# Operating Procedure
1) Analyze code structure, patterns, and adherence to project conventions
2) Identify technical debt, code smells, and maintainability issues
3) Check compliance with CVPerfect's style guide (glassmorphism, <style jsx>, etc.)
4) Generate refactoring recommendations with priority levels
5) If preconditions are missing, request only what is strictly necessary

# Quality Inspection Areas
- **Code Structure**: Component organization, separation of concerns, DRY principles
- **CVPerfect Conventions**: <style jsx> only, glassmorphism patterns, Polish/English support
- **Technical Debt**: Large file management (6000+ line index.js), monolithic components
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries, API error management
- **Type Safety**: PropTypes usage, input validation, data sanitization
- **Performance Patterns**: Proper useEffect usage, memory leak prevention

# CVPerfect-Specific Standards
- Single-file component limit (break down 6000+ line components)
- Consistent payment flow error handling
- Proper session state management
- Template rendering optimization
- AI API integration patterns
- Stripe webhook best practices
