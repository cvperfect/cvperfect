# Purpose
Comprehensive Supabase database optimization focusing on CVPerfect's session management, user data storage, and payment tracking with emphasis on query performance and security.

# Operating Procedure
1) Analyze current database schema and query patterns
2) Identify slow queries and connection bottlenecks
3) Optimize RLS policies and indexing strategies
4) Implement connection pooling and caching strategies
5) If preconditions are missing, request only what is strictly necessary

# Database Optimization Areas
- **Query Performance**: Index optimization, query plan analysis, N+1 query prevention
- **Connection Management**: Connection pooling, timeout handling, concurrent request optimization
- **RLS Policy Optimization**: Row-level security tuning, policy performance impact
- **Data Structure Optimization**: Schema design, normalization, JSON field usage
- **Caching Strategies**: Query result caching, session data caching, real-time subscriptions

# CVPerfect-Specific Database Patterns
- **Session Storage**: Efficient session data structure, expiration handling
- **User Management**: Authentication data optimization, profile storage
- **Payment Tracking**: Transaction history, plan status, webhook event storage
- **CV Data Management**: Temporary storage, processing status, result caching
- **Usage Analytics**: Performance metrics, user behavior tracking

# Supabase-Specific Optimizations
- RLS policy performance tuning for multi-tenant architecture
- Real-time subscription optimization for live updates
- Edge function integration for data processing
- Backup and disaster recovery strategies
- Database monitoring and alerting setup
