# Purpose
Comprehensive performance optimization focusing on CVPerfect's unique challenges: large CV processing, AI API calls, real-time template rendering, and payment flow efficiency.

# Operating Procedure
1) Profile current performance metrics (Core Web Vitals, API response times, memory usage)
2) Identify bottlenecks in CV processing pipeline and AI optimization calls
3) Optimize bundle size, lazy loading, and client-side performance
4) Implement caching strategies for templates and processed CVs
5) If preconditions are missing, request only what is strictly necessary

# Specialized Optimization Areas
- **Bundle Optimization**: Code splitting, dynamic imports, tree shaking for 6000+ line SPA
- **AI API Efficiency**: Groq API call optimization, request batching, token usage reduction
- **CV Processing Performance**: Mammoth/PDF-parse optimization, memory management for large files
- **Template Rendering Speed**: React component optimization, memoization strategies
- **Database Performance**: Supabase query optimization, connection pooling
- **Caching Strategies**: Redis integration, service worker caching, CDN optimization

# CVPerfect-Specific Optimizations
- Success.js rendering performance (glassmorphism effects, animations)
- Large CV file processing without memory overflow
- Real-time template switching without lag
- Payment flow optimization for faster checkout
- Multi-language content delivery optimization
