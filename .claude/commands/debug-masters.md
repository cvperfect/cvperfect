# üéØ DEBUG MASTERS COMMAND (-dm)

**Shortcut**: `-dm`  
**Full Name**: Debug Masters  
**Purpose**: Advanced AI-driven debugging using 3 specialized masters

---

## üîç WHEN TO USE

### Perfect for:
- **Complex CVPerfect bugs** (session issues, payment problems, infinite loops)
- **Unknown root causes** - when you can't identify the source
- **Systematic analysis needed** - thorough investigation required
- **High-confidence fixes wanted** - need reliable solutions
- **Pattern recognition needed** - similar bugs happened before

### Avoid for:
- Simple syntax errors (use `-fix` instead)
- Quick fixes (use `-th -fix` instead)  
- Well-understood problems (use `-debug -fix` instead)

---

## ü§ñ THE THREE MASTERS

When you use `-dm`, Claude activates all three debugging specialists:

### 1. üîç ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS MASTER
**Methodology**: Five Whys + Fishbone + FMEA  
**Strengths**:
- Systematic root cause investigation
- CVPerfect-specific pattern recognition
- Multi-methodology approach with confidence scoring
- Comprehensive analysis of People/Process/Technology/Environment factors

### 2. üß† AI DEBUGGING COPILOT MASTER  
**Methodology**: AI Pattern Recognition + Automated Fixes  
**Strengths**:
- 50+ debugging patterns in database
- 98% confidence for CVPerfect-specific issues
- Automated fix suggestions with effort estimation
- Historical learning from successful debugging sessions

### 3. ‚öôÔ∏è SYSTEMATIC DEBUGGING MASTER
**Methodology**: 8-Phase Structured Process  
**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive step-by-step approach
- Checkpoint system with rollback capability
- Evidence-based solution implementation
- Regression prevention built-in

---

## üöÄ HOW IT WORKS

### When Claude sees `-dm`:

1. **Problem Analysis** (30 seconds)
   - All 3 masters analyze the issue simultaneously
   - Pattern matching against CVPerfect database
   - Confidence scoring for different approaches

2. **Root Cause Investigation** (2-5 minutes)
   - Five Whys analysis for systematic questioning
   - Fishbone diagram for comprehensive factor analysis
   - AI pattern recognition for known issue types

3. **Solution Generation** (1-3 minutes)
   - High-confidence fix recommendations
   - Automated fixes when possible (90%+ confidence)
   - Implementation plan with rollback strategy

4. **Validation & Prevention** (1-2 minutes)
   - Regression testing recommendations
   - Prevention measures to avoid recurrence
   - Success metrics and monitoring

## üí° USAGE EXAMPLES

### Basic Usage:
```
"Fix the infinite loading bug on success page -dm"
```

### With Planning:
```  
"Analyze session data loss after payment -dm -todo"
```

### With Safety:
```
"Debug payment webhook failures -dm -fix -check"
```

### For Complex Issues:
```
"Investigate why users can't access optimized CVs -ut -dm -todo"
```

### Quick but Thorough:
```
"Fix memory leak in CV processing -th -dm -fix"
```

## üéØ EXPECTED OUTPUTS

### Confidence Scores:
- **95-98%**: CVPerfect-specific patterns (session, payment, infinite loops)
- **85-90%**: React/Next.js patterns (hooks, rendering, state)
- **80-85%**: Performance patterns (memory, loading, optimization)
- **70-80%**: General debugging patterns

### Fix Categories:
- **Automated Fixes**: Applied immediately (high confidence)
- **Guided Fixes**: Step-by-step instructions  
- **Investigation Needed**: Complex issues requiring more analysis
- **Prevention Measures**: Avoid similar issues in future

### Typical Response:
```
üéØ DEBUG MASTERS ANALYSIS:

üîç ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED (87% confidence):
- Primary: fetchUserDataFromSession infinite recursion
- Contributing: Missing MAX_RETRIES validation
- Pattern: cvperfect_infinite_retry

ü§ñ AI COPILOT RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Fix #1: Add MAX_RETRIES constant (0.5h effort, 95% success)
- Fix #2: Implement timeout protection (1h effort, 90% success)
- Fix #3: Add error handling (0.5h effort, 85% success)

‚öôÔ∏è SYSTEMATIC IMPLEMENTATION:
Phase 1: Problem scope defined ‚úÖ
Phase 2: Evidence gathered ‚úÖ  
Phase 3: Solution designed ‚úÖ
Ready for implementation with rollback plan.

üéØ RECOMMENDED ACTION:
Apply Fix #1 (automated) + Fix #2 (guided) = 95% success probability
```

## üÜò TROUBLESHOOTING

### Low Confidence Scores (<70%):
- Add more context to problem description
- Include error logs and stack traces
- Specify CVPerfect component (session, payment, CV processing)
- Use more specific terms ("infinite loop" vs "slow")

### No Pattern Matches:
- Check if problem description includes CVPerfect keywords
- Add relevant logs or error messages
- Specify user journey step where issue occurs
- Include browser/environment details

### Masters Not Responding:
- Verify agent files exist in `agents/debug/`
- Check console for initialization errors
- Try `-debug` first to validate basic debugging works
- Restart Claude Code session if needed
