# Sequential Thinking Auto-Enable Command
This command automatically enables sequential thinking mode at session start.

## Command: /sequential on
Enable multi-step task breakdown mode for complex tasks.

## Auto-execution:
The sequential thinking mode is now ENABLED for this session.

Multi-step tasks will automatically be broken down into numbered steps (1/N, 2/N, etc.)
for better analysis and execution clarity.

## Usage examples after enabling:
- Complex debugging → Sequential breakdown
- Multi-step implementations → Step-by-step execution  
- Analysis tasks → Structured approach
- Problem solving → Methodical progression

Sequential thinking is now ACTIVE and will be used automatically for complex tasks.
